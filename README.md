# tesla-powerwall2-api-to-table #

## About ##

This project was created to make it easier to extract the APIs from the tesla powerwall2 javascript files.

It's not designed to be the most efficient OR well coded as it's been written just to get the info rather than to be stylish!

### How do I use it? ###

Open up `com.github.vls29.tesla.powerwall2.PowerwallJavascriptFileExtractor` and replace the value of `TESLA_POWERWALL_ADDRESS` with the address of your powerwall2.

Run `com.github.vls29.tesla.powerwall2.ReadMeTest` using JUnit 5
